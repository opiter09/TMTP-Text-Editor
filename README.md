This is a ROMHacking tool for the DSiWare game "Too Much Tingle Pack."

To get started, download TinkeDSi by R-YaTian. If it has a release after 0.9.3, download it from here: https://github.com/R-YaTian/TinkeDSi/releases.
Otherwise, you will need to download the "nightly" version from here: https://github.com/R-YaTian/TinkeDSi/actions/runs/4741139830 (you want the "Artifact" at the bottom).

After extracting the zip, rename the folder you from TinkeDSi... to just TinkeDSi, then drag it over
into this very folder. Now open Tinke.exe in there, and choose your Dekisugi Tincle Pack ROM.
Click on the "root" folder in the tree, then press "Extract," and choose this folder as the destination.
